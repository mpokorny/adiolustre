Experimental changes to the ADIO Lustre code.

This repo is based on the directory src/mpi/romio/adio/ad_lustre in the
mpich2-1.5b1 tarball.

Makefile.mk is from MPICH2; Makefile.in, from MVAPICH2. Not sure that
Makefile.mk is actually used by the MPICH2 build process, but
Makefile.in certainly is used by the MVAPICH2 build process.

This branch replaces "normal" MPI messaging with one-sided messaging.
